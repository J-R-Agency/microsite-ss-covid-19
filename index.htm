				<h2>How does Covid-19 Core Data Tracker help our care home?</h2>
				<p>The new Covid-19 tracker app, developed by Safe Steps, enables you to gather key Covid-19 clinical  information about each of your residents. Covid-19 Core Data Tracker enables your local NHS teams to help respond to the daily pressures faced at the front line quickly and confidently. Safe Steps  has been enhanced to capture appropriate health  data for each resident. The app acts as a simple checker to allow care home managers and staff to keep track of the changing picture for residents on a daily basis. </p>
				<p>Co-created  with health and care teams across Greater Manchester to demonstrate initial proof of value, we’ve worked closely with the 24/7 NHS digital response team, GPs and care homes with positive feedback about how simple and intuitive it is to use. </p>
